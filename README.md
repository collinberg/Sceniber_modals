# Wordpress Marketing Modals

A lite weight plugin used for creating simple modals in wordpress using ACF.

## Getting Started

Currently I do not queue ACF on my own, so you need to have ACF active on your site. You do not need the Pro Version.


```
Give examples
```

### Installing

1. Upload wp-post-modal.zip to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory and extract
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
3. Add the class modal-link to open the href of that link into a modal window.

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
